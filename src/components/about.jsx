                  I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in
                  full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very
                  enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects
                  of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect
                  design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code

                  When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me
                  hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the
                  journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can
                  follow me on Twitter where I share tech-related bites and
                  build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
